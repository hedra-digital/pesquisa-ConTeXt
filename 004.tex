But chiefly, when the shadowy moon had shed
O'er woods and waters her mysterious hue,
Their passive hearts and vacant fancies fed
With thoughts and aspirations strange and new,

Till their brute souls with inward working bred
Dark hints that in the depths of instinct grew

Subjection not from Locke's associations,
Nor David Hartley's doctrine of vibrations.

Hey diddle diddle, the cat played the fiddle,
The cow jumped over the moon.
The little dog laughed to see such craft,
And the dish ran away with the spoon.

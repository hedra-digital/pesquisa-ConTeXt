 8     Thus, I came to the conclusion that the designer of a new
 9     system must not only be the implementer and first

13     The separation of any of these four components would have
14     hurt \TeX\ significantly. If I had not participated fully in
15     all these activities, literally hundreds of improvements
16     would never have been made, because I would never have
17     thought of them or perceived why they were important.

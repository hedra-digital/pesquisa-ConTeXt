\subject{Introduction}
\unknown\ America has always been a land set firmly not in the past, but
in the future. On a recent visit to England, I found dozens of wonderful
bookstores chock full of the past --- ancient history, rooms full of it,
and great literature in such monumental stacks as to be overwhelming. In
the usual American bookstore, history might occupy a few bookcases; great
literature has its honoured place, but this year’s paperbacks dominate. The
past is not disregarded, but neither does it loom so large and run so deep
in our blood.

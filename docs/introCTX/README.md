# LaTeX versus ConTeXt

I do not believe that either one of these two philosophies is preferable to
the other. The question depends rather on the user's profile and what he or
she wants. If the user does not want to deal with typographical issues but
simply produce very high quality standardised documents, it would probably be
preferable to opt for a system like LATEX; on the other hand, the user who
likes to experiment, or who needs to control every last detail of the
document, or someone who has to devise a special layout for a document, would
probably be better off using a system like ConTEXt, where the author has all
the control in their hands; with the risk, of course, of not knowing how to
use this control correctly. (p.28)
